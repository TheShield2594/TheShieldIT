title: The Eyes Alliance
description: The Five Eyes Alliance (FVEY) might be one of the most significant intelligence-sharing coalitions youâ€™ve never encountered until now. While it is promoted as a tool for national security, its widespread surveillance and data interception practices bear striking similarities to global monitoring operations.

The main purpose of these alliances is to share information with each other. After WW2, UKUSA agreement was signed which is now the NSA and the British Government Communications Headquarters. The banded together to share intelligence. 

Despite the frequent media focus on intelligence activities by countries like Russia and China, this Anglosphere surveillance network often flies under the radar. Meanwhile, nations such as China, Russia, India, and, to a lesser extent, Japan also operate their own independent intelligence frameworks outside these alliances.

Five Eyes countries - United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand
Nine Eyes countries - The Five Eyes plus Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, and France
Fourteen Eyes countries - The Nine Eyes plus Italy, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, and Spain
Partners of the Fourteen Eyes - Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, British Overseas Territories
These alliances have the capability to gather and retain your online activity through sources like your internet service provider (ISP), third-party monitoring, or activity trackers.

This information may include your IP address, browsing and search histories, phone and video calls, private messages, emails, and virtually anything transmitted over your internet connection. In essence, if it moves through the internet, it can potentially be monitored, logged, and archived. The Fourteen Eyes Alliance also possesses the capability to intercept phone communications. In the United States, this practice is permitted under the Patriot Act, which was introduced following the events of 9/11. Although there have been multiple efforts in recent years to limit the powers granted by the Patriot Act, Congress has repeatedly rejected these measures, allowing the surveillance programs to persist.


Many individuals in the privacy space may make their decisions based on this information. Deciding on a VPN, Email, etc. may be impacted by if the company resides in one of the alliances above. If you find that with the information above, you are one of those individuals who do not want these countries sharing data about you, reference this when deciding on a new online product.
